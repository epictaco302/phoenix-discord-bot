# TacoBot
TacoBot (originially Phoenix) is a FOSS Discord bot owned and maintained by EpicTaco. It doesn't have much in terms of features, but if you want to add some, you happily fork the project.

# How to run
Make sure you have node.js installed on your PC. If it is, open up a terminal window in the root directory of the source code, install the dependencies by running `npm install ascii-table common-tags discord.js dotenv express random-puppy superagent moment`, replace `PUT_TOKEN_HERE` in the configuration file (config.json) with your bot's token, and run `node index.js`.
